<h1>Common Types of Wounds</h1>

<h2> Laceration wound 

<h3> A laceration is a wound that is produced by the tearing of soft body tissue. This type of wound is often irregular and jagged. A laceration wound is often contaminated with bacteria and debris from whatever object caused the cut.<p>

      
<h2> Punctured Wound

<h3> A puncture wound is usually caused by a sharp pointy object such as a nail, animal teeth, or a tack. This type of wound usually does not bleed excessively and can appear to close up. Puncture wounds are also prone to infection and should be treated appropriately.<p>

<h2> Abrasion 

<h3> An abrasion is a scrape on your skin. This is a break in your skin that happens when your skin rubs off. It may bleed slightly and hurt. An abrasion often happens when something hits or drags against your skin (friction). Abrasions are usually accidental injuries. They only affect the outermost layers of your skin.<p>

 <p>What are the types of abrasions?

<p>There are three types of abrasions:

<p>Linear: A linear abrasion is also known as a scratch. It’s damage to your skin in a line-like pattern. It’s the result of a sharp, pointed object like a thorn making contact with your skin.

<p>Grazed: A grazed abrasion or brushed abrasion is skin damage caused by your skin making contact with or dragging across a rough surface. This type of abrasion can cover a large area of your skin. An example would be a skinned knee.

<p>Patterned: A patterned abrasion is skin damage caused by an object forcefully making direct contact with your skin and rubbing against it. The wound on your skin matches the size and shape of the object that your skin touched. An example is the nail markings caused by a cat scratch. The feline’s claws reflect the size and shape of wounds they make on your skin. <p>

<h2>Avulsion 

<h3>An avulsion fracture is where a small piece of bone attached to a tendon or ligament gets pulled away from the main part of the bone. Ligaments hold your bones, joints and organs in place while tendons connect muscles and bones. In an avulsion fracture, your bone moves one way and your tendon or ligament moves in the opposite direction with a broken chunk of bone in tow. This most often happens when you suddenly change direction. <p>

<h2>Burns 

<h3> A burn occurs when heat, chemicals, sunlight, electricity or radiation damages skin tissue. Most burns happen accidentally.

<h2> Burn degrees include:

<h3>First-degree burns are mild (like most sunburns). The top layer of skin (epidermis) turns red and is painful but doesn’t typically blister.

<h3>Second-degree burns affect skin’s top and lower layers (dermis). You may experience pain, redness, swelling and blistering.

<h3>Third-degree burns affect all three skin layers: epidermis, dermis and fat. The burn also destroys hair follicles and sweat glands. Because third-degree burns damage nerve endings, you probably won’t feel pain in the area of the burn itself, rather adjacent to it. Burned skin may be black, white or red with a leathery appearance.<p>

<h2>Surgical Wounds

<h3>  A surgical wound is a cut or incision in the skin that is usually made by a scalpel during surgery. A surgical wound can also be the result of a drain placed during surgery. Surgical wounds vary greatly in size. They are usually closed with sutures, but are sometimes left open to heal.

<h2> What are the types of surgical wounds?

<h3> Surgical wounds can be classified into one of four categories. These categories depend on how contaminated or clean the wound is, the risk of infection, and where the wound is located on the body.

<h3>Class I: These are considered clean wounds. They show no signs of infection or inflammation. They often involve the eye, skin, or vascular system.

<h3>Class II: These wounds are considered clean-contaminated. Although the wound may not show signs of infection, it is at an increased risk of becoming infected because of its location. For example, surgical wounds in the gastrointestinal tract may be at a high risk of becoming infected.

<h3>Class III: A surgical wound in which an outside object has come into contact with the skin has a high risk of infection and is considered a contaminated wound. For example, a gunshot wound may contaminate the skin around where the surgical repair occurs.

<h3>Class IV: This class of wound is considered dirty-contaminated. These include wounds that have been exposed to fecal material.<p>

<h2>Bedsores (Ulcers)<p>

<h3> Bedsores are wounds that occur from prolonged pressure on your skin. People who are immobile for long periods, such as those who are bedridden or use a wheelchair, are most at risk for bedsores. <p>

What are the stages of bedsores?
Healthcare providers use a staging system to determine the severity of a pressure ulcer.

<h2>Stages of bedsores or pressure ulcers include:

<h3> Stage 1: Your skin looks red or pink, but there isn’t an open wound. It may be hard for people with darker skin to see a color change. Your provider may refer to this stage as a pressure injury. Your skin may feel tender to the touch. Or your skin might feel warmer, cooler, softer or firmer. <p>

<h3> Stage 2: A shallow wound with a pink or red base develops. You may see skin loss, abrasions and blisters. <p>

<h3> Stage 3: A noticeable wound may go into your skin’s fatty layer (the hypodermis). <p>

<h3> Stage 4: The wound penetrates all three layers of skin, exposing muscles, tendons and bones in your musculoskeletal system. <p>
